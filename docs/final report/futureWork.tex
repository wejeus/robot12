Movement control: The linear movement can be improved by implementing the same acceleration limitation as the angular movement function uses to make the movement even smoother.
	If the complexity of the environment increases one should consider another method of exploring the environment than wall following in the sense itâ€™s implemented now. A more complex environment would need many more states to be able to handle all possible situations and a more complex state machine will be very hard to debug.
