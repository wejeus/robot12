Our task is to design the robot that can go into the ``house'' (the maze), build a map of it and detect and identify objects, and later use this knowledge to plan a path and execute a ``fetch all objects mission'' as fast as possible.

\subsection{The two phases}
Phase 1: Exploration and mapping
\begin{itemize}
\item In the first phase our robot is supposed to explore the house (maze), build a map and localize objects and identify them. We are penalized if our robot is not out of the maze within the time limit, which is 7 min.
\item The output of this phase is a map with the position and identity of objects marked.
\item The robot should report when it finds an object and give information about the identity and color.
\end{itemize}


Phase 2: Pathfinding and fetch objects
\begin{itemize}
\item In this phase our tasks is to go into the house and fetch as many objects as possible as fast as possible.
\item We fetch an object by positioning ourself infront of it. Some part of the robot needs to be at most 10cm from the tag for it to be considered a correct fetch. The camera need to be within 5cm from the normal from that tag.
\item Speed is important in this phase, i.e. we get extra points if the robot is fast.
\end{itemize}
