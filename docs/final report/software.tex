This section describes the software that we used, a class diagram of our implementation and a flow chart of how the robot interacts with its environment.

\subsection{Software used}
The robot needs to execute multiple tasks and react on many inputs at once. Therefore we were recomended to use Robot Operating System (ROS) which is a software framework that can be run on other *nix-like operating systems like GNU/Linux and Mac OS X.

Other software that we used were:
\begin{itemize}
\item Git for version controlling.
\item Gcc for compiling our C-code.
\item Python 2.7 for running some scripts and for map visualization.
\item OpenCV for computer vision.
\item Google Sketchup for drawing 3D models.
\item Fabric, a python library, for copying binany files from the workstation to the robot.
\end{itemize}
