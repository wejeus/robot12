The robot turned out not to provide all the functionalities to fully fulfill the tasks.

The overall movement control of the robot performed well and the wall following can deal with a lot of different wall constellations while moving fast and close to the walls.
The localization and mapping as well performed very well in many tests. Though there are still some possible improvements which were presented in the respective section.

The computer vision performed apart from difficulties due to differnt lightning conditions also very well. It was possible to correctly classify a number of tags without even stopping the robot.

Due to the lack of time we did not manage to fully integrate all the functionalities into different high level strategies for exploring the maze and collecting tags. The path execution is still not stable and reliable why it wasn't even used during the competition. 

Thanks to the fast wall follower and to the fast computer vision we still managed to get through the maze in the competition in time and detect and classify at least some tags.
