The code is separated into two parts: motor controller and movement controller.
The motor part only controls the pwm's for the motors and the movement part
is for high level control.

Usage:
roslaunch amee milestone0.launch

Starts ROS and launches our nodes (MotorControl and MovementControl.py)

Test functionality by using script located in robot12/bin
./go.py forward <number meters to travel (positive/negative)>
./go.py rotate <number of degrees to rotate (positive/negative)>
./go.py point <x coordinate> <y coordinate>

For keyboard input use the turtlesim turtle_tele_op ros node.

Have fun!
